Lincoln High School Robotics Software sponsored by Bob Steele (bsteele.com)

Uses GWT (http://www.gwtproject.org/) to compile the Lincoln simulation into JavaScript on the browser to display a simulation of robot motion.

The project is a Maven project (https://maven.apache.org/index.html) meant to be run by Intellij's Idea IDE (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
community version (Download, select operating system, Community download).  It will likely run in most modern browsers but
Google's Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome) is the browser of choice.
