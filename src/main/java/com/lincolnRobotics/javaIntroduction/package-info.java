/**
 *Start here for a very minimal introduction to the java programming language in the HelloWorld class.
 * <p>The use of java for robot control is a very complex and difficult task for the novice user.
 * The HelloWorld class and it's comments were designed to give a painfully quick and brutal introduction
 * into the minimum java features required to control robots.</p>
 * <p>Good luck, some of the techniques here take years to master... but I'll bet you don't have that much time.</p>
