/**
 *
 * All classes unique to the Lincoln JavaFx simulation belong here.
 * <p>The main code will find all classes that implement the interface RobotMotionSequencer
 * in the com.lincolnRobotics.robotAutonomous package and present them as an option to run.
 * </p>
 * <p>JavaFx initialization and visualization are all controlled here.
 * Note that this means the robot autonomous package does not reference javaFx.
 * This allows it to sequence robot motion commands in other environments, such as the EV3 and FRC robots.</p>
